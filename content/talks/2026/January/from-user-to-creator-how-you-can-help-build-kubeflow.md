## Abstract

Abstract: We have spent the day learning how to use Kubeflow. Now, let’s talk about how we can build it together.

**Our goal is simple**: We want more developers from India contributing to the global Kubeflow project. In this final session, we will show you that you don't need to be an expert to get started. You will learn:
  - **You don’t need to be a "Pro"**: Why fixing documentation, testing installation guides, and reporting bugs are just as important as writing complex code.
  - **A Role for Everyone**: Whether you are a student, a data scientist, or a web developer, there is a specific way you can help right now.
  - **Practice Locally**: How to use our new Indian community group to practice your skills before sending changes to the global project.
  - **Get Started Today:** A simple guide to joining Slack groups so you can make your first contribution this weekend.
